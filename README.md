### 👌 ABOUT TESTTING CODE 
Testing your application's logic with test suites has always been an important part of software development;
> a framework like Mocha or Jasmine, or spinning up DOM-dependent tests in a headless browser like PhantomJS, our options for unit testing JavaScript are better now than ever. However, this doesn’t mean the code we’re testing is as easy

### procees of testing code 

```
Go to Code Editor and run this npm command : 
npm install --save-dev @babel/plugin-transform-modules-commonjs

```
And after that creat the file named : .babelrc and inside the file 
you can paste this code code below : 

```

{
  "env": {
    "test": {
      "plugins": ["@babel/plugin-transform-modules-commonjs"]
    }
  }
}

```
>IMPORTANT PART IS TO CREATE **JEST.CONFIG.JS** and paste the file those following code 

```
module.exports = {
  testEnvironment: 'jest-environment-jsdom',
